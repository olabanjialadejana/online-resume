    <hr />
    <p>
      An experienced remote sensing scientist with expertise in analyzing large
      volumes of remotely sensed imagery to obtain accurate and scalable
      geospatial data products, I possess deep knowledge in remote sensing,
      geospatial analytics, time series analysis, and ecosystem properties. This
      allows me to fuse data from a wide range of Earth observation satellites,
      UAVs, and ground-derived data to provide precise information on
      environmental variables relevant to making informed business decisions.
